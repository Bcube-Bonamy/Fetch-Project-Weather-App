# Fetch Project Weather App

This is broken bcuz i removed the api key lmaoo

To fix it you have to restore the apiKey global variable and also in the getWeatherData function you have to enter ${apiKey}

Here is the link to the site https://bcube-bonamy.github.io/Fetch-Project-Weather-App

I will style it soon with Tailwind and maybe remake a new repo when I figure out how to clean it and remove the api key.
